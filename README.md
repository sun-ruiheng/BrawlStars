# BrawlStars

Pre-Project Ideas Entry:
24 Aug 2021

I hope to make a beautiful and functional Brawl Stars website / fan site that is informational and fun to use. It should utilise the Brawl Stars API, at least some bits of it, to allow retrieval of accurate information and also allow me to practise using APIs and requests, and maybe asynchronous operations in a real situation.
I also want this to be interesting to my friends who play Brawl Stars.
What exactly will be in here, I'll decide along the way. For now, definitely player info, brawler info, and my and my friends' spectacular Brawl Ball goals.

Update:
7 Nov 2021

The API is poorly documented and frustrating to use. I've given up on this project for now.
